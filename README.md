# Kevin

**Kevin** is a highly interactive, keyboard-driven Terminal User Interface (TUI) for managing tasks and orchestrating AI agents. It is written in Go and uses the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework.

## Overview

Kevin acts as a Kanban board for your terminal, where every task is a Markdown file. It's designed to:
*   **Manage Tasks**: Vim-style navigation, Kanban columns, and file-based storage.
*   **Orchestrate Agents**: Delegate tasks to external CLI tools (AI agents) via Docker or local execution.
*   **Stay Reactive**: Updates in real-time as files change on disk.
